# Frontstart Course

I took this course in order to learn VueJS, but also used the opportunity to refresh some basic concepts of frontend most common stacks for beginners.

It has three main projects:
- Personal portfolio: developed only using HTML and CSS;
- VueJS: simple todo list;
- VueJS: final project - e-commerce;

This repo will be a one stop shop for all projects above.
